### Title: 
Draw UML Use case diagram for an ATM machine. Explain the different component of a use case diagram.

###Theory: 
A use case diagram is a graphical representation of the functional requirements of a system, showcasing how users interact with the system and the system's responses. It's part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is widely used for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting software systems. 
Different component of a use case diagram - 
Actor: An actor is an external entity that interacts with the system.
Use Case: A use case represents a specific functionality or a discrete piece of the system's behavior.
Association: An association line connects an actor to a use case and represents the interaction between them.
Include Relationship: This relationship indicates that one use case includes another. 
Extend Relationship: The extend relationship indicates that one use case can extend another under certain conditions. 
Generalization Relationship: This relationship represents inheritance between use cases. 
System Boundary: In some use case diagrams, a system boundary may be drawn around all the use cases and actors to represent the system's scope.
System: In some cases, a use case diagram may include a "system" actor to represent the system itself when it interacts with external systems.

### Explanation: 
In an ATM machine, the user enters the card, user name, and PIN to check balance, withdraw money, and deposit money from the banking system, whereas the banking system can validate the user ID and request a mini statement to check balance.

### Title: 
Draw UML Sequence diagram for an ATM machine. Explain the different component of the diagram.

### Theory: 
A sequence diagram is a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram used to visualize the interactions and communication among objects or components in a system over a specific period of time. Sequence diagrams are commonly employed in software design and systems engineering to illustrate the flow of messages and the sequence of events in a system's operation. 

### Explanation: 
In an ATM machine, the user enters the card, user name, and PIN to check balance, withdraw money, and deposit money from the banking system, whereas the banking system can validate the user ID and request a mini statement to check balance.
